# README

This directory contains an example application using UIScript.

It is both an Eclipse as well as a NPM project.


## Installation

To open and manipulate model files, you have to open this project using an Eclipse which has the UIScript plugins running
    - see [main README](../README.md).

To install the necessary "Web things", execute `npm install` or `yarn install` in this directory.
For this you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) which typically co-installs NPM.
As an alternative to NPM, you can use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/).

After installing all NPM dependencies, simply do the following:

* `npm start`/`yarn start`: start the Web server at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000/).
* `npm run watch`/`yarn run watch`: start watching code changes.

After changing model files in `model/` or source files in `src/`, these changes should be compiled automatically after at most a few seconds, after which you can reload the browser tab to see the effects.


## Organisation

* `model/`: contains the model files in UIScript (file extension: `.uiscript`).
* `node_modules/`: JS dependencies installed by NPM.
* `src/`: non-generated JS/TS source.
* `src-gen/`: JS/TS source generated by UIScript ends up in here.
* `web/`: Web "stuff".
* Plus: the usual top-level NPM and Eclipse "stuff".
